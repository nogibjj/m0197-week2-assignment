## Pandas Descriptive statistics 
This repository contains code for displaying descriptive statistics of specified columns from any CSV file. A user has to provide the dataset name as an argument and specify the columns they want to analyze. If no columns are specified, the code will default to displaying statistics for all numeric columns.
